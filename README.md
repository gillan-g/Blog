The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2020 to better understand:

1. Explore proffesional coding experience and satisfaction level, are there any interesting trends?
2. for survey participants coming from a non programming related degree, is there a relationship to the number/frequency of visits to stack overflow when compred to programming related backgrounds
3. If we inspect each country seperatly, what are the lowest 5 paying countries on a salary per hour calculation? what are the top 5 countries? 

## File Descriptions
1. Stack Overflow 2020 survey results .CSV file
2. Stack Overflow 2020 survey schema .CSV file
3. Jupyter notebook .ipynb file used fro processing the data
4. Directory jenerated by Jupyter

## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here.
