## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2020 to better understand:

1. Explore proffesional coding experience and satisfaction level, are there any interesting trends?
2. for survey participants coming from a non programming related degree, is there a relationship to the number/frequency of visits to stack overflow when compred to programming related backgrounds
3. If we inspect each country seperatly, what are the lowest 5 paying countries on a salary per hour calculation? what are the top 5 countries? 

## File Descriptions
1. Stack Overflow 2020 survey results .CSV file
2. Stack Overflow 2020 survey schema .CSV file
3. Stack Overflow readme file README_2020.txt
4. My readme file README.txt
5. Jupyter notebook .ipynb file used fro processing the data
6. Directory jenerated by Jupyter

## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here.
